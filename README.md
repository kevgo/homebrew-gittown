homebrew-gittown
================

Why, howdy there! You look mighty gitty today if I do say so myself.

This repository is a Homebrew tap that allows users to use Homebrew to easily install and keep Git-Town up-to-date. This is NOT the actual Git-Town repository. You're probably looking for https://github.com/Originate/git-town instead.

There's more than enough room in this town for the two of us. I reckon we could probably fit several thousands more in this here fine git town. Now why don't yall bring some friends after yur done lookin around?
